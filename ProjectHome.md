JcsPhotoGallery (Just Client Side Photo Gallery) - a photo gallery project developed in GWT. "Just Client Side" means the gallery doesn't need any servlet container addressing the issue on Virtual Private Servers (with low RAM memory) or Web Hosting without server side support.

The application is released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

The last version (1.1.1) comes with a desktop application (it runs on Windows, Linux and Mac) to easily manage the gallery. Currently installer for Windows is available, and soon for Linux and Mac.
Version 1.0.6 is the last from 1.0.x. It includes some code updates part of the new 1.1.x version, and released to keep compatibility with the previous gallery format, as the new gallery format has been changed.
